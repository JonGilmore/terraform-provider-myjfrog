# myjfrog_custom_domain_name (Resource)

Provides a MyJFrog [Custom Domain Name](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-hosting-models-documentation/manage-custom-domain-names-in-myjfrog) resource to manage custom domain names. Also see [Custom Domain Name REST API](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/custom-domain-name-rest-apis) for more details.

To use this resource, you need an access token. Only a Primary Admin can generate MyJFrog tokens. For more information, see [Generate a Token in MyJFrog](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-hosting-models-documentation/generate-a-token-in-myjfrog).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "myjfrog_custom_domain_name" "my-custom-domain-name" {
  certificate_name = "mycert"
  certificate_body = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIETzCCAzegAwIBAgIGAY...jLjELMAkGA1UECwwC\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
  certificate_chain = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIETzCCAzegAwIBAgIGAY...jLjELMAkGA1UECwwC\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
  certificate_private_key = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEowIBAAKCAQEAqXr...rEgIP8TXkOkCaiA\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
  domains_under_certificate = [
    {
      url = "servername1.com"
      server_name = "serverName1"
      type = "platform_base_url"
    }
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_body` (String) A certificate body is a text field containing information about the certificate such as the domain name, public key, signature algorithm, issuer, and validity period. You may include the certificate chain in the certificate body.
- `certificate_name` (String) Give your certificate a unique name to help identify it.
- `certificate_private_key` (String, Sensitive) The private key pairs with the certificate's public key for encryption. The keys must match. Private key must be in RSA format (RSA PKCS#1). If not, you can convert it to RSA using the following OpenSSL command:
`openssl rsa -in private.key -out private_rsa.key -traditional`
- `domains_under_certificate` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domains_under_certificate))

### Optional

- `certificate_chain` (String) A chain of trust between certificates that is anchored by a root certificate authority is used to verify the validity of a certificate.

### Read-Only

- `certificate_expiry` (Number)
- `certificate_status` (String)
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--domains_under_certificate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `domains_under_certificate`

Required:

- `server_name` (String) The server_name field in your request refers to the designated JFrog server where you intend to configure a CNAME (Canonical Name). For instance, if your JFrog server URL is myserver.jfrog.io, and you wish to set up a CNAME for this server, you should enter `myserver` in the server_name field.
- `type` (String) This attribute offers two valid options:
  * `platform_base_url`: Use this option when configuring the base URL for accessing the JPD (JFrog Platform Distribution) User Interface. You can also employ this URL as the base for API calls.
  * `docker_sub_domain`: Use this option when configuring the base URL for Docker-related operations, such as login, pull, and push actions, within the JPD. Please note that this parameter is exclusively available for JPD instances that have the Docker Subdomain method configured.
For more detailed information on the various Docker methods available in Artifactory, please refer to [Get Started With Artifactory as a Docker Registry](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/get-started-with-artifactory-as-a-docker-registry).
- `url` (String)

Optional:

- `docker_repository_name_override` (String) Only available when `type` is set to `docker_sub_domain` (when configuring the base URL for Docker-related operations). Use this option when you wish to define an explicit repository name (not derived from the domain name) -  please notice this is not best practice.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import myjfrog_custom_domain_name.my-custom-domain-name cert-id
```
